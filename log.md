# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: Januvary 28, Satursay

**Today's Progress**: Created a React Calculator App.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](calculator-topaz-ten.vercel.app)


### Day 2: February 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I have created an infinite scroll gallery.

**Thoughts** Again stugggled a little bit with the css.
